	<h1>About coelacanth</h1><br>
	<p>
		The coelacanth is a well-known example of a "living fossil": a surviving relic of a fish lineage that dates back approximately 400 million years. To be clear, the phrase "living fossil" does not imply that the present coelacanth fish is unaltered. Color and behaviour, for example, have experienced some changes. It simply implies that this fish has kept the key traits of its ancient ancestors that are no longer found in other species or have become extremely rare over time. <br><br>
		This species was considered to have become extinct at the same period as dinosaurs 65 million years ago. However, the discovery of this fish by a South African museum curator in 1938 generated quite a stir in the scientific world. Because of its scarcity, each specimen is valued for its prospective scientific worth.
	</p><h1>Facts</h1><br>
	<p>
		The coelacanth fish can survive at depths of up to 2,300 feet. Its eyesight is ideally suited to see in this deep water habitat.<br><br>
		The brain of the coelacanth fish is very small, accounting for only 1.5% of its total cerebral cavity. The rest of the skull is made up of fat.<br><br>
		In the popular Nintendo video game series Animal Crossing, you may catch and proudly exhibit this fish in your aquarium.<br><br>

	<h1>Coelacanth Classification and Scientific Name</h1><br>
	<p>
		Coelacanthiformes is the scientific term for the whole coelacanth order. The name coelacanth is said to be derived from a Greek word that means "hollow spine". Latimeria is the genus name for all currently existing coelacanth species. Taxonomists named this after Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, who is credited with discovering the fish in 1938.	</p><br>
	<h1>Coelacanth Appearance</h1><br>
	<p>
		A lobe-finned fish is something like a coelacanth. The presence of limb-like lobed fins is the distinguishing feature of this type of fish. These fins protrude from the body and include several bones and muscles that move in an alternating rhythm similar to horse trotting. This is in stark contrast to the wave-like motion used by many other fish species. It has been proposed that this fish has changed so little since its origins due to a stable environment, a lack of severe predators, or other conditions that would ordinarily promote considerable evolutionary change.</p><br><br>
		<!-- <h2>Predators</h2>
		<p>The coelacanth is reported to feed largely on smaller fish species such as the superb alfonsino, brotula barbata, cardinal fish, and bronze whiptail. It also consumes cephalopods including octopus, squid, and cuttlefish.</p> -->

	<h1>Coelacanth Distribution, Population, and Habitat</h1><br>
	<p>
		Because this fish is so uncommon, it's difficult to predict where else it could live with any certainty. The only known species appears to have a spotty distribution over the East African and Southeast Asian shores. The coelacanth spends the most of the day hidden in underwater caverns before emerging to eat at night. The West Indian Ocean coelacanth is severely endangered, but the Indonesian coelacanth is just vulnerable, according to the IUCN Red List. Some conservation efforts have been impeded by a lack of understanding about its behaviours, but merely limiting unintentional captures may go a long way toward saving the species.</p>

	<h1>Coelacanth Predators & Prey</h1><br>
	<p>The coelacanth is a passive drift feeder, meaning it glides slowly through the water and picks up whatever prey occurs to pass by. It is thought to be towards the top of the food chain, but because some specimens exhibit bite marks and a developed fight or flight reaction, there may be predators above it who have no qualms about chewing into a coelacanth.</p><br><br>
	<h2>Prey</h2>
		<p>The coelacanth is reported to feed largely on smaller fish species such as the superb alfonsino, brotula barbata, cardinal fish, and bronze whiptail. It also consumes cephalopods including octopus, squid, and cuttlefish.</p><br><br>
		<h2>Predators</h2>
		<p>Although no predator has ever been personally witnessed consuming a coelacanth, it has been speculated that sharks may occasionally feast on it.</p>
